[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/continental/ecal.svg?style=flat)](LICENSE.txt)

The **e**nhanced **C**ommunication **A**bstraction **L**ayer (eCAL) is a middleware that enables scalable, high performance interprocess communication on a single computer node or between different nodes in a computer network.
eCAL provides a **publish - subscribe** pattern to connect different nodes in the network with almost no configuration required.

This eCAL core uses **UDP** only for all kind of communication.

Visit the eCAL Documentation at üåê https://ecal.io for more information.
