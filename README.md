# The eCAL Cop (core only project)

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/continental/ecal.svg?style=flat)](LICENSE.txt)

The **e**nhanced **C**ommunication **A**bstraction **L**ayer (eCAL) is a middleware that enables scalable, high performance interprocess communication on a single computer node or between different nodes in a computer network. 

This eCAL core version has an reduced functionality compared to [Eclipse-eCAL](https://github.com/eclipse-ecal/ecal) (see _Differences to Eclipse-eCAL_). The goal of this reduced approach is to create a core with as few dependencies as possible, which should facilitate integration into embedded environments or smart sensors.

Visit the eCAL Documentation at üåê https://ecal.io for more information.

## Differences to Eclipse-eCAL
  - communication core only, no additional eco system tools
  - C++ and C language support only
  - udp transport layer only (no shared memory, no tcp)
  - no monitoring API
  - no logging over udp (console and file target still supported)

Apart from these limitations, this functional reduced eCAL core version is fully compatible with Eclipse-eCAL. It uses the UDP layer for local and cross-host communication. As a result, it offers lower performance for local host only setups, but it has no drawbacks for network-based (udp) communication.

## How to build

```bash
mkdir _build
cd _build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
